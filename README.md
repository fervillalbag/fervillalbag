Frontend Developer with over 5 years of experience in creating exceptional digital experiences. My primary focus revolves around ensuring that every button, view, and functionality of the applications I develop works flawlessly, with the intention of providing the best possible user experience.

In my day-to-day work, I employ a carefully selected set of technologies to achieve this goal. My development stack includes React, which is my primary tool for creating dynamic and engaging user interfaces. I complement React with Typescript to ensure more robust and secure code. For styling and design, I rely on Tailwind CSS, making it easier to create beautiful and functional interfaces.

Furthermore, I use Radix UI to enhance accessibility and usability in my applications, allowing me to deliver a high-quality user experience. To manage databases and data storage, I turn to PostgreSQL and TypeORM, ensuring that data is handled efficiently and securely.

In my journey towards backend development, I'm embracing NestJS, a Node.js platform that enables me to build robust and scalable backend applications.

To streamline the deployment and management of my applications, I utilize Docker, which allows me to containerize my applications and simplify the deployment process.

Regarding my development environment, I currently work on Windows 11 and use Visual Studio Code with Bash to write code efficiently and effectively.
